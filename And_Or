Introduction: Good morning/ Good afternoon, My name is (Student’s name) and I am studying in grade (Student’s grade).
Our aim of project is to demonstrate a closed circuit.


Components required:

1. Component holder
2. Battery holder
3. Batteries
4. Connection poles
5. Wires (as required)
6. LED

Building:

•	Take the component holder and place the battery holder and pressed on it and now place the batteries into the battery holder.
•	 Place the connection poles on either side of the battery holder at a distance.
•	Connect the battery holder terminals to the connection poles to the either side using wires.
•	 Then place the LED at a distance on the component holder and connect the negative terminal wire to negative connection poles of the battery and similarly positive wire to the positive connection poles of the battery.

Working/Demonstration:

•	Then the circuit will be closed and power flows from the battery to the LED and LED will be ON or glows. Thank you.
