Introduction: Good morning/ Good afternoon. My name is (Student’s name) and I am studying in grade (Student’s grade).

In this project, we will create a simple Flappy Bird game where the player controls a bird by pressing the space bar to make it "flap" and avoid obstacles. 
The game will include gravity, where the bird falls automatically, and the player must keep it flying by timing their spacebar presses. 
We will use Scratch sprites and coding blocks to control the bird's movement, generate obstacles that scroll across the screen, and detect collisions. 
Players will score points based on how far they can go without crashing into the obstacles.

Thank you.
