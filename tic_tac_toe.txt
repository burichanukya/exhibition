To create a Tic-Tac-Toe game in MIT App Inventor, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the UI**:  
   - Open MIT App Inventor and start a new project.
   - Design the layout by adding a 3x3 grid of buttons for the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
   - Add labels to display the status (e.g., whose turn it is) and a reset button to start a new game.

2. **Initialize Variables**:  
   - Create variables to store the current player (X or O), the board’s state, and the game status (e.g., whether there’s a winner or if it’s a draw).

3. **Program Button Clicks**:  
   - Use the "Button.Click" event to detect when a player clicks a grid button.
   - Update the button text to X or O based on the current player.
   - Check for a winning combination or a draw after each move.

4. **Winning Logic**:  
   - Create a procedure to check if there are three identical symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
   - Display a winning message and disable further moves if there’s a winner.

5. **Reset Functionality**:  
   - Program the reset button to clear the board and reset all variables for a new game.

6. **Test the App**:  
   - Test the game on an emulator or connected device to ensure it works as expected.

This step-by-step process will guide you in creating a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game in MIT App Inventor.
