Tic-Tac-Toe game


Introduction: Good morning/ Good afternoon. My name is (Student’s name) and I am studying in grade (Student’s grade).
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players that's played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking the squares with X or O, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row wins.
A row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.


Thank you.
